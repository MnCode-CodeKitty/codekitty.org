Our workshops have helped over 200 students succeed at coding, robotics, and engineering. All of our donations go back into providing our robot kits and instructional materials as cheaply as possible, and we rely on grants to cover our operational costs.

## Suggested Donations

We've worked really hard to keep our costs down, and are proud to offer our 3 hour in person workshop, which includes the robot kit, for a low suggested donation per student.  If this isn't feasible for you, head to our Contact page and talk to us about it. We can probably work something out!  All amounts are per student.  Stay tuned for more workshop options (including online/remote) in the near future!

### In person/small group

#### A 3D printed robot kit for each student

Three hours of hands-on instruction in building the robot and coding in Python.
