{{% details "#### ðŸ—€ Lights" %}}

- There are ten led lights called *Neopixels* on your robot.
- They are numbered 0-9 (not 1-10!) in a circle starting with the one to the left of the USB jack, and going around *counterclockwise*.
- *Note: setting a pixel to **black** turns it off!*

To set one to a color, use:

```python
pixels[x] = colors['c']
```

*where **x** is a number between 0 and 9, and **c** is the name of a color in colors[]*

To set them ALL, you can use a for() loop:

```python
for i in range(10):
  j=i-1
  pixels[j] = colors['*c*']
```

*(replace c with the name of the color)*
