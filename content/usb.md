{{% details "#### ðŸ—€ Board" %}}

The Circuit Playground (express or bluefruit) circuit board in your robot comes with two motors connected to it (the yellow connectors on **A3** and **A6**). 

These two "analog pins" (**A3** and **A6**) are just two of the connectors you can use on your robot. These are defined in a special library called **board**, and if you want to use them, first do:

```python
import board
```

And then if you want to list all of the connections defined in **board**, do:

```python
dir('board')





To set one to a color, use:

```python
pixels[x] = colors['c']
```
