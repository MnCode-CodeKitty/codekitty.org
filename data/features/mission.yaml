description: "We are a Minnesota based 501(c)(3) non-profit whose mission is to show girls and BIPOC students that technology skills are available to anyone with an interest, and to cultivate that interest in as many learners as possible. We believe that diversity is essential to our future success, and that we all do better when we all do better."
