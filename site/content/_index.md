  text: >-
    We are a Minnesota based 501(c)(3)  non-profit whose mission is to show
    girls and BIPOC students that technology skills are available to anyone with
    an interest, and to cultivate that interest in as many learners as possible.


    We believe that diversity is essential to our future success, and that we all do better when we all do better.

values:
  heading: Our values
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
