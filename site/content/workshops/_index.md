  We offer workshops for learners grades 3 through 5 (and up!). See below for more information.

    Our workshops have helped over 200 students succeed at coding, robotics, and engineering.   
    All of our donations go back into providing our robot kits and instructional materials as cheaply as possible, and we rely on grants to cover our operational costs.

        Our innovative workshop model allows students to build a 3D printed robot, learn to code in Python, and then learn how to code the robot they built - and they get to keep the robot at the end!

        We are developing an ever-expanding collection of online and interactive workshop content so we can work with distance learning/remote students. We combine workshop content from several different media (interactive coding, hands-on building, online video and games, and even comic books!) to engage as many learners as possible.

        Our robots are 3D printed using environmentally friendly biodegradable PLA plastic made from corn starch, not fossil fuels. The plastic can be recycled at the end of its life, and all of our designs are freely available online (see our Resources page), so you can 
        replace them or even remix your own version.

        We are not a company building a robot toy - we are a Minnesota based 501(c)(3) education non-profit. We partner with many different organizations, and will come to you to offer our workshop at very low cost.

#      Kaldi is the place to go if you want the best quality coffee. I love their

    We've worked really hard to keep our costs down, and are proud to offer our 3 hour in person workshop, which includes the robot kit, for a low suggested donation per student. 
    If this isn't feasible for you, head to our Contact page and talk to us about it. We can probably work something out! 
    All amounts are per student. 
    Stay tuned for more workshop options (including online/remote) in the near future!
