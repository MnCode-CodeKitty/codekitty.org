      <description>Our workshops have helped over 200 students succeed at coding, robotics, and engineering. All of our donations go back into providing our robot kits and instructional materials as cheaply as possible, and we rely on grants to cover our operational costs.
Suggested Donations We&amp;rsquo;ve worked really hard to keep our costs down, and are proud to offer our 3 hour in person workshop, which includes the robot kit, for a low suggested donation per student.</description>
